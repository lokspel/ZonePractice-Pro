# ZonePractice

ZonePractice is a modular, production-ready Minecraft PvP/practice plugin written in Java and built with Maven. It is
organized into multiple modules (core logic, platform-specific builds, and distribution packaging) and supports all
major server forks commonly used by competitive PvP networks.

## Documentation

For detailed guides on setup, configuration, and feature usage, please visit our official GitBook:
👉 **[ZonePractice Pro Documentation](https://zone-developement.gitbook.io/zonepractice-pro/)**

## Features

- Ladder, Arena, FFA and Event systems
- Profile management, leaderboards (holograms), sidebars and tablists
- Match engine, kit handling, inventories and utility helpers
- Optional PlaceholderAPI support
- Compatible with Paper/Spigot, FoxSpigot, Carbon and similar forks

## Supported Versions

- Primary targets: **1.8.8**, **1.8.9** (legacy), and **modern 1.20.6 / 1.21.X**
- Actual supported versions are detected at runtime via the `VersionChecker`
- The plugin automatically disables itself on unsupported versions

## Dependencies

### Optional – PlaceholderAPI

Provides additional placeholders when installed. Add the PlaceholderAPI jar to your server’s *plugins/* folder to enable
integration.

### Required (runtime) – PacketEvents

ZonePractice uses PacketEvents for packet-level features. PacketEvents must be installed as an external plugin, not
shaded into ZonePractice.  
**How to install PacketEvents:**

1. Download a compatible build from: https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents/releases
2. Stop your server
3. Place **PacketEvents** and **ZonePractice** into the *plugins/* directory
4. Start the server and ensure PacketEvents loads before ZonePractice  
   Do **not** bundle PacketEvents inside the ZonePractice jar. Keeping it external ensures correct load order and
   compatibility.

## Repository Structure

- **core/** – main logic and shared systems (`practice-core-*.jar`)
- **spigot_1_8_8/** – legacy 1.8.8 platform build
- **spigot_modern/** – modern 1.20.x / 1.21.x builds
- **distribution/** – release packaging (`ZonePractice Pro v*.jar`)
- **libs/** – helper jars and forked server builds for development

## Cloning & Git LFS

This repository uses **Git LFS (Large File Storage)** to manage heavy binary assets, such as the server builds and
dependencies located in the `libs/` folder.

To ensure that you download the actual files instead of small text pointers, you **must** have Git LFS installed on your
system before cloning or pulling updates:

1. **Install Git LFS:** Run `git lfs install` (only needs to be done once per machine).
2. **Clone the Repo:** Use your standard `git clone` command.
3. **Troubleshooting:** If the files in `libs/` appear as 1KB text files, run:
   ```bash
   git lfs pull
   ```
   This will manually sync the large binary assets to your local workspace.

## Building

1. Install JDK (Java 17+ recommended for modern builds) and Maven
2. Run: `mvn clean package`

## Installation (Server)

1. Place the appropriate build (distribution jar or a specific platform module) into *plugins/*.
2. Start the server and watch the console or `logs/latest.log`.
3. On first startup, the plugin will generate configuration files under `plugins/ZonePracticePro/`.

## Configuration

- Default configuration files are generated automatically. Templates live under `core/src/main/resources/<version>/` (
  e.g., `config.yml`, `divisions.yml`, `guis.yml`, `inventories.yml`).
- `config.yml` includes a `VERSION` field (e.g., 13 for the legacy 1.8.8 template). Review updated templates when
  upgrading.
- Optional MySQL storage is available via the `MYSQL-DATABASE` section; back up configs before enabling.
- Read console output for version validation, warnings and load messages.
- PlaceholderAPI functionality is automatically enabled when detected.

## Commands & Permissions

All commands and permission nodes are defined in `core/src/main/resources/plugin.yml`.  
Common commands include `/practice` (aliases: `/prac`, `/zonepractice`, `/zoneprac`, `/zonep`), `/arena`, `/ladder`,
`/duel`, `/party`, `/spectate`, and many more.  
Permissions follow the `zpp.*` namespace, such as `zpp.admin` (default: op), `zpp.practice.*`, `zpp.staffmode`, and many
granular nodes.

## Soft Dependencies & Load Order

Defined in `plugin.yml`:

- `softdepend: [PlaceholderAPI, Multiverse-Core, FastAsyncWorldEdit, LiteBans]`
- `loadbefore: [CMI, CMILib]`  
  These integrations enhance features but are optional.

## Troubleshooting

### PacketEvents Not Found

- Ensure PacketEvents is in *plugins/* and loads **before** ZonePractice
- Restart the server instead of hot-loading plugins

### MySQL Errors

- Verify MySQL settings in `1.8.8/config.yml` or `modern/config.yml`
- Ensure the database accepts external connections
- JDBC is handled via `DriverManager`; ensure a suitable MySQL driver is available

## Plugin Metadata

The canonical `plugin.yml` is located at `core/src/main/resources/plugin.yml` and defines:  
`name: ZonePracticePro`, `api-version: 1.13`, commands, permissions, soft dependencies, and load rules.
